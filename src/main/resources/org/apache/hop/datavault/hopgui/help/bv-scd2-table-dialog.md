# Business Vault SCD2 table

An SCD2 table in the Business Vault model (`.hbv`) materializes a **functional Type 2 timeline** from one or more raw Data Vault satellites: version rows with validity bounds (`valid from` / `valid to`), not a Type 1 overwrite table and not a PIT pointer table.

Use this dialog to name the target, choose satellite derivatives, set the functional timestamp and build mode, and map attributes for multi-satellite merges.

## What this table is for

- **Harmonize** multi-satellite history into one consumable timeline (for example Customer 360).
- Keep **organizational memory**: each business change becomes a new version with closed/open validity intervals.
- Feed **downstream** dimensional models, reports, and other BV objects with a clean SCD Type 2 grain.

Raw vault satellites remain insert-only (technical load history). SCD2 rewrites that history into **business-effective** intervals driven by the functional timestamp you configure.

## General

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Logical name of the SCD2 table on the canvas and in the model. |
| **Physical table name** | Target table in the Business Vault database. |
| **Derivatives** | One or more DV satellite references. At least one satellite is required. |
| **Include hash key** | When enabled, the parent hub/link hash key is written to the BV table. |
| **Functional timestamp** | Column used as the timeline for validity bounds (see resolution order below). |
| **Build mode** | `FULL_REBUILD` (truncate and reload) or `INCREMENTAL` (watermark, append, close open rows). |
| **Incremental watermark field** | Optional BV column for `MAX(...)` watermark reads; defaults to the functional timestamp. |
| **Valid from / Valid to** | Output column names for SCD2 interval bounds (model defaults apply when empty). |

### Functional timestamp resolution

Priority order:

1. Per-satellite override in **Satellite configs**
2. Per-table **functional timestamp** on this dialog
3. Model-level functional timestamp in Business Vault configuration
4. Load-date fallback from Data Vault configuration (often `x_load_ts`)

The functional timestamp drives interval boundaries — not the technical load date unless you choose that column explicitly.

### Build mode

- **Full rebuild** — truncate and reload the BV table from satellite history.
- **Incremental** — read satellite deltas above a watermark, close the prior open version, append new versions. Prefer after an initial full load when history is large.

Use **Debug** or **Show build pipeline** on the canvas to inspect the generated Hop pipeline before workflow runs.

## Field mappings

Required when **two or more** satellites feed the table. Map each `(satellite, source field)` to a BV target column name. Validation checks parent hub/link consistency, source field existence, and unique target columns.

Single-satellite tables can pass attributes through under DV names unless you add explicit mappings for renaming or subsetting.

## Satellite configs

Optional per-satellite settings for multi-satellite merges:

- Functional timestamp override for that satellite
- Source indicator value when you need to tag which satellite contributed a version

## Type 1 vs Type 2 (important)

**This dialog builds pure SCD Type 2 only.** Every mapped business attribute is carried on version rows; history is not rewritten when a “current” value changes later.

| Need | Recommended approach |
|------|----------------------|
| Full history / as-of attributes | Keep them on this SCD2 table (Type 2). |
| Always show the **current** value (e.g. current sales rep on old facts) | Join a **current** object at mart or query time — open SCD2 row, latest satellite, or a BV SQL “current” table/view. Prefer **hybrid Type 1 + Type 2 in the dimensional model**, not by overwriting SCD2 history. |
| Mix Type 1 and Type 2 **in the same BV SCD2 table** | Not supported as a field mapping mode. Hybrid presentation belongs downstream or in a separate current-state object. |
| Type 1 / Type 2 modes **on a PIT table** | Wrong layer. PIT stores hub key + snapshot + satellite load-timestamp **pointers**; compose attributes (including always-current ones) when you join. |

**Why not Type 1 “update all history” on BV SCD2?**

1. As-of queries become silently wrong for columns that only *look* historical.
2. BV intermediate history should stay audit-friendly; back-propagating current values fights that role.
3. Mass updates across all versions are expensive and awkward with incremental watermarks.

Business Vault SCD2 is **consumable organizational memory**. Dimensional models own presentation rules such as hybrid slowly changing dimensions.

Longer guidance: project doc `docs/business-vault-scd2.adoc` (section *Type 1 vs Type 2 and hybrid attributes*).

## Tips

- Run **Check model** on the `.hbv` file before **Business Vault Update** or Debug.
- Confirm **Data Vault target** (read satellites) and **Business Vault target** (write SCD2) connections both resolve in project metadata.
- After changing the linked `.hdv` on disk, use **Reload DV model** on the Business Vault toolbar.
- External read-only satellites are skipped by Data Vault Update but remain valid SCD2 sources if the vault DB can read them.
- Multi-satellite example: `integration-tests/tests/multi-satellite-bv/customer-360.hbv`.
