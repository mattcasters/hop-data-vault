# Hub editor

A **Hub** stores the business key(s) that identify a core concept (Customer, Order, Product, …) plus a surrogate hash key.

## Three meanings of "record source"

| Concept | Where you set it | Example |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| **Catalog feed** | Record sources tab | `CRM-customer` (a DV_SOURCE in the Data Catalog) |
| **Value in the vault row** | Catalog source → source indicator or indicator field | `CRM` or a column from the feed |
| **Target column name** | Model config, or per-hub override below | `RECORD_SOURCE` or `src_invoice` |

The **Record sources** tab lists **catalog feeds**, not table columns.

## Options tab

- **Integration mode** — Hop managed (default), external read-only, or custom pipelines.
- **Physical table name** — Target table; defaults to the hub name.
- **Hash key field name** — Surrogate key column (e.g. `customer_hk`). Satellites and links reference this.
- **Record source field name** — Optional per-hub override for the record source **column** name in the hub table. Hub satellites inherit this name when loading.

## Keys tab

- **Business keys** — Natural keys in hub column order (composite keys supported).
- **Source field name** — Physical column in a feed when it differs from the hub column name.
- **Source system** — Which catalog feed this key mapping belongs to. Must appear on the Record sources tab.
- **Load from source** — Fills keys from the first feed on the Record sources tab (run once per feed for multi-source hubs).

## Record sources tab

List every **catalog DV_SOURCE** that supplies business keys for this hub. One hub box can have many feeds; use **Source system** on the Keys tab to map different column names per feed.

Use **Check model** on the toolbar to validate empty record sources, missing catalog indicators, and key mappings before running pipelines.
