# Business Vault model settings

Open with **Edit model** on the Business Vault graph toolbar.

## Header

- **Name** / **Description** — model identity (name may sync with the `.hbv` filename).

## General tab

- **Target database** — connection where Business Vault tables and views are created and loaded.
- **Data catalog** — metadata catalog connection (`MetaSelectionLine`). Used for catalog publish and model-registry lookups. Business Vault Update falls back to this when the action leaves catalog empty.
- **SCD2 defaults** — functional timestamp, load-date fallback, valid-from / valid-to column names.

## Data Vault tables (canvas, not this dialog)

There is **no** single “linked Data Vault model file” setting. Reference hubs, links, and satellites from **one or more** `.hdv` models by placing canvas aliases:

- Context menu: **Add Hub / Satellite / Link reference**
- Pick a catalog-registered DV model or browse a `.hdv`
- Each alias stores an optional `referencedModelFilename` for multi-model sources

SCD2, PIT, SQL `ref()`, and Business Vault Update resolve DV tables from those aliases.

## Target loading / Generated artifacts tabs

Shared target-load mode (table output vs staging file), batch size, parallel copies, and generated pipeline / workflow name prefixes.

## Tips

- Use **Check model** on the graph before running Business Vault Update.
- Multi-step BV layers can also reference other `.hbv` files via SQL `ref()` or canvas **Business Vault references**.
