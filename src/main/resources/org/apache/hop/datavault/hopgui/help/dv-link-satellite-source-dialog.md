# Link satellite source

A **link satellite source** connects one catalog **DV_SOURCE** feed to the **link satellites** attached to a link. It answers: *from this source, which columns supply the descriptive attributes (and driving keys) for each link satellite?*

Link hub sources load **who is related to whom**. Link satellite sources load **what we know about that relationship** over time.

## When you need this dialog

Use it when a link has descriptive attributes historized on a **link satellite**:

1. Create a satellite with **Parent link** set (not parent hub).
2. List that satellite under **Participating link satellites** on the link Options tab.
3. On the link **Satellite sources** tab, add a catalog feed and click **Edit satellite source mappings…**

If the link only stores keys with no changing attributes, you can skip satellite sources entirely.

## Data Vault Source

Select the catalog **DV_SOURCE** that carries link-satellite attributes. Often this is the **same feed** as the link hub source (e.g. an order-line table with keys plus quantity and price). It can also be a separate enrichment feed.

Configure the physical layout and record source indicator in the Data Catalog before mapping.

## Link satellite attribute mappings

For each **participating link satellite** on the link Options tab, add a satellite mapping row and click **Edit mappings**.

### Attribute mappings

Map each satellite attribute to a source column:

| Satellite attribute field | Source field name |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Attribute on the link satellite (e.g. `quantity`) | Column in this source (e.g. `qty_ordered`) |

Rules:

- Map attributes you want historized. Leave the satellite Attributes tab empty to auto-include non-key fields from the feed when using **Load from source** on the satellite editor.
- Mappings are **per source** — different feeds can use different column names for the same attribute.
- **Include in CDC** on the satellite controls whether attribute changes create new satellite rows.

### Driving key mappings (multi-active link satellites)

When a link satellite is **multi-active** (several current rows per link key), define a **driving key** on the satellite's General tab. Then map it here:

| Driving key | Source field name |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Driving key on the satellite (e.g. `line_number`) | Source column (e.g. `line_number`) |

Driving keys let one order–product link carry multiple order lines as separate satellite timelines.

## Hub sources vs satellite sources

| Concern | Configured on | Loads into |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Hub business keys from relationship row | **Hub sources** | Link table |
| Descriptive attributes on the relationship | **Satellite sources** | Link satellite table |

Both can reference the same catalog feed and the same physical table. Configure **hub key mappings** on the hub source dialog and **attribute mappings** on this dialog.

Typical bridge-table pattern (`order_line`):

| Mapping type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| Hub source | `order_id` → hub_order, `product_id` → hub_product |
| Satellite source | `quantity`, `unit_price`, `discount_pct` → satellite attributes; `line_number` → driving key |

Load order in a vault update: hubs first, then links, then link satellites (orchestrated by the Data Vault Update action).

## Step-by-step workflow

1. Create link satellite with **Parent link** set to your link.
2. Define attributes (or plan to load from source) on the satellite **Attributes** tab.
3. On the link **Options** tab, add the satellite under **Participating link satellites**.
4. On **Satellite sources**, add a row and select the catalog **DV_SOURCE**.
5. Click **Edit satellite source mappings…**
6. **Add satellite mapping** for each link satellite fed by this source.
7. **Edit mappings** — map each attribute (and driving key if multi-active) to source columns.
8. Set the satellite **Default record source** to the same catalog feed name.

Repeat for additional feeds when different attributes come from different systems.

## Validation

**Check model** verifies:

- Mapped source columns exist in the catalog field list
- Attribute fields exist on the referenced link satellite
- Driving keys referenced in mappings exist on the link or link satellite as configured

## Tips

- Link satellites require a **default record source** on the satellite editor even when keys and attributes come from the same table.
- Use one link satellite per catalog feed when feeds disagree on attribute columns (same pattern as multi-source hub satellites).
- Check **Has descriptive attributes** on the link Options tab as documentation when you attach link satellites.
- Run **Check model** after mapping to catch missing catalog fields before the first load.
