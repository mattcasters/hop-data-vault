# Hop Data Vault plugin — feature overview

Apache Hop plugin for **model-driven Data Vault 2.0**, **Business Vault**, and **dimensional** loading. Version **0.0.16-SNAPSHOT** (last 0.0.x) targets **Apache Hop 2.18.1** and **Java 21**.

**Model once. Generate loads and consumption layers.** The visual models (`.hdv`, `.hbv`, `.hdm`) are the contract between architects, modelers, and operations.

For a slide-style executive summary, see [presentations/hop-data-vault-overview.md](presentations/hop-data-vault-overview.md). For DV concepts and canvas usage, see [datavault-plugin.adoc](datavault-plugin.adoc).

## Major capabilities

### Data Catalog and sources

Record definitions of type **`DV_SOURCE`** describe logical feeds: record-source indicator, optional **group** for partial loads, and physical layout (database table today). Definitions live under namespace `hop/{project}/sources` in the project `catalog-data/` tree and open in the **Data Catalog** perspective.

Hubs, links, and satellites reference source **names**, not raw connection details — one stable vocabulary from catalog through models to generated pipelines.

### Raw Data Vault (`.hdv`)

Visual modeler for hubs, links, and satellites with embedded configuration (target database, hashing, sentinels, column names, pipeline options). Toolbar actions: **Edit model**, **Import sources**, **Check model**, **Generate DDL**, **Debug**, optional **AI Help**.

**Data Vault Update** workflow action validates (optionally), generates DDL, stages update pipelines, and runs them in parallel with a shared load timestamp.

### Model validation

**Check model** in the GUI and model checks in update actions share one engine: structural rules plus optional **detailed data type checking** against live source schemas. Catalog **resource definition validation** adds feed-level checks with remediation proposals and acknowledgements.

### Business Vault (`.hbv`)

Linked to a `.hdv` model. Defines **SCD2** consumption tables (single- or multi-satellite merge) and **PIT** helpers. **Business Vault Update** validates, optionally publishes target layouts to the catalog, generates SCD2 build pipelines, and orchestrates parallel execution.

### Dimensional modeler (`.hdm`)

Kimball star/snowflake modeling: dimensions, facts, junk dimensions, bridges, snapshot facts, and aggregates. **Dimensional Publish** drafts a `.hdm` from a `.hdv`; **Dimensional Update** loads the mart. Shares canvas interaction patterns with the DV modeler.

### Execution maps (`.hem`)

Crawl a root workflow or model and persist a graph of workflows, models, generated pipelines, and source datasets. Open `.hem` files in Hop GUI for execution and lineage views. The retail example includes maps for its main update workflow and the six-month simulation.

### AI Help

Optional LLM advisory on Data Vault models, pipelines, and workflows — scenarios, context inclusions, review-before-apply proposals. Configure under Hop GUI → **Configuration → AI Assistant**.

The **Performance tuning** scenario can include load-run metrics and propose model configuration changes (parallel copies, preload lookup cache) after review:

### Pipeline transforms

- **Record Definition Input** — stream catalog record definitions (or fields) as pipeline rows.
- **Date Dimension Generator** — populate standard calendar dimension attributes.

### Operations

Docker-based runners (`scripts/run-hop.sh`, `run-postgres.sh`), parallel pipeline orchestration, **record source group** partial loads, catalog-backed load-run metrics, workflow load overview reports (Begin/End Vault Update), and per-table duration bars on model graphs. See [operations.adoc](operations.adoc) and [performance-tuning.md](performance-tuning.md).

## Sample projects

| Project | Use for |
|---------|---------|
| **[retail-example](../retail-example/)** | Learning path — CSV → CRM → DV → BV → DM, initial and monthly updates |
| **[integration-tests](../integration-tests/)** | CI/regression — Customer 360, multi-active, external read-only, golden datasets |

![Retail 360 Data Vault model](images/data-vault-model-retail-example.png)

**Recommended path:** [getting-started-retail.adoc](getting-started-retail.adoc) → reference adoc → [getting-started-integration-tests.adoc](getting-started-integration-tests.adoc) for advanced fixtures.

## 0.1.x focus

The transition from 0.0.x to 0.1.x emphasizes:

- Documentation completeness and accurate catalog-first workflows
- Validation UX (model checks + catalog issue handling)
- Retail tutorial as the primary onboarding path
- Hardening existing modelers and actions rather than large new subsystems
